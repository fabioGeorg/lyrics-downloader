# lyrics-downloader
This app is in console-mode only.
# How to download a lyrics
LyricsDownloader.exe {artist} {title}
# Important
If the artist or the title is splitted in multiple words, you must use a quote (e.g LyricsDownloader.exe "Some Artist" "Some Title").
# Issue
Sometimes when you have successfully downloaded a lyrics, the characters inside the text file is not encoded the way they should.
I think it depend of the lyrics in the song.
